# underwater-image-enhancement-using-python
Computer vision project which deals with the enhancement of underwater images

Enhancing images is essential for accurately interpreting deep-sea visuals, as light penetration diminishes in deeper areas, and longer wavelengths are absorbed in shallower waters. Furthermore, particles in the water increase turbidity, reducing image clarity. By leveraging various open-source Python libraries, these issues can be addressed to produce clearer images.

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand the latest available image processing techniques to enhance the underwater images. 

**Challenges:**
•	Loss of true object colour due to scattering, light absorption  
•	Water turbidity 
 
**Available Techniques:**
•	Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization Technique (CLAHE)
•	Colour Correction Method
•	Using Machine Learning models (Sea-thru)

**Proposed Methodology:**
•	To remove blue/green colour on provided underwater image 
 
**Tech Stack:** 
•	Software platform: Python  
•	Libraries:  NumPy, PIL, OpenCV
